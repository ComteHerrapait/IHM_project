Once the application is open, you'll get on a login page. (To log in, use the API [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in/).)
You will also find a register button to create your account (not implemented). 

Once you're logged, you will find a list of users that has been generated with the previous API. By clicking on a profile, details of the user will be printed on screen. Press the back button on the top-left corner of the screen if you want to go back.

On the user list page, at the end of the list, there is a button which send a POST request to create a user by using the API. Open your console and look the "Network" tab to check.

Finally, at the bottom of the screen, you'll find a log out button. By pressing it, you'll be redirected to the login page.
